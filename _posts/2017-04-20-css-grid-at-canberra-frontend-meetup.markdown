A few nights ago I attended the Canberra Front End Meetup at Oakton and gave a presentation on CSS Grid. I had a really great time getting to know everyone and I think my presentation went down pretty well. There was also a talk on how to build an app for Slack by Tim Berman that was very interesting, definitely something I should look a bit more into.

If you live or work nearby I highly recommend you come along to the next meetup, a great bunch of people and I got plenty of ideas for my next project. It was well worth while. I've pasted a link to the Meetup page below and also a copy of my slides from my presentation, hopefully there is some useful information in there!
